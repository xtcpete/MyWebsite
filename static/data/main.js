However, ab initio simulations of defect structures are constrained by system size, while the representative simulations of amorphous silicon (aSi) require a large amount of computation because of the wide distribution of relevant local structures. We propose a machine learning-based approach to replace the quantum mechanical ab initio calculations to identify defect formation in aSi-related structures. We demonstrate that with a correlated set of descriptors and a representative set of training data, the machine learning method can identify localized defects in structures containing Si-structures with high fidelity.",

                "Abstract": "Establishing consistent and dense correspondences across multiple images is crucial for Structure from Motion (SfM) systems. Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.",
